INTERACTIONS WITH USERS
What We Do

Through Evventor, we provide a platform for facilitating the business-to-business, business-to-consumer, or peer-to-peer sharing, rental, and sale of products and services between Users. We charge fees for using our services, which we may change from time to time by posting the changes on the Evventor site 14 days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.

When renting an item through Evventor, you enter into a legally binding contract once you commit to rent an item or if your request is accepted by the Vendor. The actual contract for rental is directly between the User and the Vendor. You may be asked to agree to terms of agreement specifically set by the Vendor. These terms may be customized to fit a particular Vendor’s needs. Evventor is not responsible for reviewing, verifying, or guaranteeing the accuracy of any information in any terms of agreement set by a Vendor. Vendors may change their terms of agreement from time to time, with or without notice. Evventor is not responsible with providing Users notice when a Vendor changes its terms of agreement. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR, MUST EVALUATE AND MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT ABOUT, AND BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REVIEWING ANY TERMS OF AGREEMENT SET BY A VENDOR BEFORE RENTING AN ITEM OR REQUESTING TO RENT AN ITEM. Vendors may also set cancellation policies, which may be waived or reduced at the Vendor’s discretion, but Users are otherwise expected and legally obligated to abide by the terms of any cancellation policy associated with a rental. Cancellation policies may be general and/or specific to a particular item or type of item, and one or more cancellation policies may apply to a given rental request. Each cancellation policy may provide a different rate or schedule of rates for a particular item or type of item. Vendors may change their cancellation policies from time to time, with or without notice. Evventor is not responsible with providing Users notice when a Vendor changes its cancellation policy. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR, MUST EVALUATE AND MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT ABOUT, AND BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REVIEWING ANY CANCELLATION POLICY SET BY A VENDOR BEFORE RENTING AN ITEM OR REQUESTING TO RENT AN ITEM.

What We Don’t Do

We do not directly or indirectly participate in any transactions between Users of Evventor, and we do not verify or guarantee the truth or accuracy of any information posted by any User with regard to the existence, availability, authenticity, quality, or value of any item offered through Evventor. We do not and cannot guarantee that transactions entered into between Users will be completed.

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR, MUST EVALUATE AND MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT ABOUT, AND BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH (I) YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS, WHETHER ONLINE OR IN PERSON, AND (II) YOUR USE OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE BY OTHER USERS.

You acknowledge that we do not screen or investigate the background of any Users, nor do we verify or otherwise warrant the accuracy of any representations or statements made by any User to you or others regarding their products or services. Your dealings with Users, and any other terms, conditions, representations or warranties associated with such dealings, are between you and such User exclusively and do not involve Evventor or its sponsors or enterprise partners. It is your sole responsibility to make any necessary, appropriate, prudent, reasonable or judicious investigation, inquiry, research and due diligence with respect to User Content and take whatever precautions you deem necessary or appropriate prior to interactions and transactions with other Users, whether online or in person. Evventor AND ITS SPONSORS AND ENTERPRISE PARTNERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE BACKGROUND OR CONDUCT OF ANY USER.

E-COMMERCE
Registration to use Evventor is free of charge. All prices and fees in connection with products and services offered by Users through Evventor, including the amounts of any security deposits, are established by individual Users. All prices and fees listed through Evventor should be in U.S. Dollars (including $0 U.S. Dollars for an item offered without charge). Evventor does not support barter transactions, (i.e., offering to rent an item in exchange for another product or service). Prices and availability of goods and services offered by users may change due to market conditions and without notice. You may pay individual Users for your orders through Evventor with a variety of forms of payment. GS itself does not process such payments. GS uses Stripe (“Stripe”) payment services to process payments, which accepts Visa®, Mastercard®, Discover® and American Express®. By using the Stripe payment services available through Evventor, you agree to provide your financial account and related billing information to Stripe, be bound by Stripe’s terms and conditions (available at https://stripe.com/us/terms along with its privacy policy:https://stripe.com/us/privacy), and you hereby consent and authorize us to share the information you provide to us with Stripe to the extent required to provide the payment services to you. Stripe may also be contacted directly for payment support at info@stripe.com. Payment information is required at the time that you place a rental order (i.e., offer to rent from another User) but, generally, your payment method is not charged until the owner of the rental accepts your rental order. However, we may pre-authorize your order amount with your card issuer at the time you place a rental order.

From Stripe: Payment processing services for Users on GS are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to this Agreement or continuing to operate as a User on GS, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of GS enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide GS accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize GS to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

Any refunds of fees charged in connection with the rental are within the discretion of the Vendor of the item in question.
